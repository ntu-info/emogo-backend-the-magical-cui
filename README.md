# Export data

See and download emogo export data here: [emogo-backend](https://emogo-backend-the-magical-cui.onrender.com/export)

**Note.** The new EmoGo app function for uploading mood ratings and GPS locations to this backend is still under development. As a result, you may see several entries with identical ratings and no associated videos on the export page, or some entries not sorted well; this is expected at the current stage.
